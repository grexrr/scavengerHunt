# scavengerHunt

**Scavenger Hunt(Un-named)** is an interactive Java-based location puzzle game enhanced by a Python backend. The game challenges players to find real-world landmarks based on riddles. Players navigate a rendered map, receive clues, and interact using keyboard and mouse controls. The system evaluates user actions and determines success based on spatial accuracy and orientation.

### Dev Log

#### Mar. 24 2025
**Remark: The log is scratch written in Chinese and generated with help of ChatGPT. It WILL NOT be used for thesis paper submission.** 

- Project bootstrapped using Spring Boot 3.4.4 with Maven (Java 17)
- Initialized base package: `com.scavengerhunt`
- Added `.game` module:
  - **Player**: encapsulates core player data, including location, orientation, solved landmarks, and game status
  - **PlayerStateManager**: manages player's game state transitions and interactions, such as current target updates and game completion
  - **Landmark**: defines the landmark data model (ID, name, location, riddle, solved status)
  - **LandmarkManager**: handles landmark filtering, selection, and navigation logic during a game session
- Added `.utils` module:
  - **GeoUtils**: performs geographical distance calculations (Haversine formula) used for radius checks and proximity comparison
- Added `.data` module:
  - **LocalGameDataManager**: MVP-stage repository that loads hardcoded landmarks and saves player progress via standard I/O or console

##### Project Progress Summary (up to Mar. 24, 2025)

This phase focused on **validating module communication, state transitions, and data flow**, in preparation for the MVP milestone. Specifically, the goal was to ensure that the core gameplay logic — player progress tracking, landmark selection, riddle sequencing — could function end-to-end even without a graphical interface.

##### Modules Designed and Tested:
- `Player` / `PlayerStateManager`: encapsulates user position, solved history, and current puzzle state
- `Landmark` / `LandmarkManager`: supports filtering landmarks by radius, selecting the next target by proximity, and separating loaded landmarks (`localLandmarks`) from dynamically updated game targets (`unsolvedLandmarks`)
- `GeoUtils`: utility for distance-based filtering
- `LocalGameDataManager`: temporary I/O controller to load landmark data and save solved history
- **TestRunner** (Pipeline testing data transmission between Module): simulated game loop that loads data → selects puzzle → marks solved → selects next

##### Data Flow Simulated:
1. Player initializes at fixed lat/lng coordinates
2. Landmarks are loaded from a stubbed source (`LocalGameDataManager`)
3. The player defines a circular search area (simulated radius)
4. A filtered puzzle pool is created → the nearest landmark is selected
5. Player “solves” the puzzle → LandmarkManager updates `unsolvedLandmarks`
6. The next target is chosen based on proximity
7. If no further landmarks remain, the game ends and the state is saved

##### Issues & Solution:
The module-oriented development approach has led to structural confusion issues. We have decided to adopt a **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD) + Use Case First development methodology for the next phase of work to see if it can alleviate these problems.


#### Next Step: MVP UI Integration

Having validated the core gameplay logic in a console-based simulation, the next step is to begin **UI-layer integration**, where player inputs and spatial movement will drive visual feedback and real-time interactions.

##### Goals:
- Implement a minimal graphical UI
- Display player position and surrounding landmarks
- Simulate area selection (A key → drag to create search radius)
- Show directional arrow to guide player toward current target
- Enable answer submission (B key) with orientation validation
- Sync UI feedback with existing game state logic (PlayerStateManager & LandmarkManager)


#### Mar. 29, 2025

##### Updated Design Notes

- Separated the pure data layer (`LandmarkRepo`) from the stateful game logic (`PuzzleController`)
- Introduced `MapUIStateManager` to sync internal state with frontend rendering
- Added `GameSession` as the bridge between logic and UI, encapsulating player and puzzle states
- Kept `PuzzleController` focused on single-round management: provides methods such as `submitAnswer()`, `getCurrentTarget()`, and `isFinished()`
- The UI layer communicates exclusively with `GameSession` or `GameUIController`

##### Frontend Strategy (Revised)

- The MVP map is rendered using Leaflet inside an HTML page, embedded through JavaFX WebView or opened in a browser window
- User interaction is handled through key/mouse/touch input passed to the backend
- Future extension paths:
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile browser compatibility
  - Embedding the WebView into a native Android/iOS app using frameworks such as Flutter, React Native, or Cordova
  - Full native mobile frontend rewrite for later phases (as needed)

##### Progress Recap

###### PuzzleController & LandmarkRepo Refinement
- Responsibilities clarified:
  - `PuzzleController` maintains round-specific state, such as the target pool and progress tracking
  - `LandmarkRepo` acts as a data provider with geospatial filtering, no longer maintains round state
- Achieved strict use-case alignment by avoiding logic duplication and state coupling

###### Session Layer Implementation
- `GameSession` introduced to orchestrate state between player, puzzle logic, and data
- Ensures a clean API surface for the frontend
- Facilitates long-term modularity and scalability

###### UI Prototype Integration
- `UIController` implemented as the first-layer interface between the frontend and logic
- Tested a terminal-based MVP flow:
  - Initializes a player
  - Applies a search radius to create the puzzle pool
  - Handles answer submission and target progression
  - Detects game completion cleanly


##### Insights from MVP Debugging

- `GameDataRepo` should evolve into a unified backend communication hub:
  - Manages not only landmark/riddle retrieval, but also future player data syncing
  - Will eventually integrate with a Python REST API backend

- Layer separation (Repo ↔ Controller ↔ Session ↔ UI) proved valuable for testability and logic clarity

##### Next Focus Areas

###### 1. Simulated Player Movement
- Add tools to manually or programmatically update player position
- Dynamically affect game state and puzzle logic
- Used to validate spatial correctness and navigation feedback

###### 2. Distance-Based Puzzle Validation
- Implement `evaluateCurrentTarget()` with geolocation checks
- Later enhance to include directional angle (facing logic)
- Might involve an `AnswerEvaluator` utility or similar abstraction

###### 3. Strengthen Frontend Visualization
- Decide and initiate the map rendering layer:
  - JavaFX + embedded Leaflet HTML
  - Or fully browser-based progressive web frontend
- Immediate goal: visualize player and landmarks on a map

---

##### Reflection

Although the game logic layer is solid, the UI brings substantial added complexity. Key challenges include:

- Interactive graphics (maps, players, arrows)
- User input handling (mouse and keyboard)
- Synchronizing state across logic and UI layers

However, once the map visualization is functional, additional game features will become significantly easier to build.

---

#### Apr. 17 2025

**Goal: Establish frontend-backend interaction using Leaflet-based map interface, replacing the prior CLI `TestRunner`. Focused on player initialization via map click and modular JavaScript structure.**


- Created `index.html` to host a full-screen Leaflet map, simulating player location input by clicking
- Designed and separated client logic into JS modules:
  - `player_click_init.js`: first-click event listener for player init, calling `/api/game/init`
  - `main.js`: application entrypoint, loads the map and mounts init handler
- Adopted **global function style** for frontend scripts for simple browser-based testing, avoiding ES module complexity

- Backend:
  - Added `GameRestController` with `@RestController` + `/api/game` prefix
  - Implemented `POST /api/game/init` endpoint with `PlayerInitRequest` DTO
  - Connected endpoint to `UIController.initGame(...)`, confirming Spring Boot logs display proper coordinates upon frontend interaction
  - Verified full chain: map click → fetch → POST JSON → session initialized


##### Static Resource Structure

```
resources/
└── static/
    ├── index.html
    ├── main.js
    └── player_click_init.js
```

##### Design Notes

- Global-scope JS functions selected over ES Modules for MVP simplicity
- State flag `gameInitialized` is used to guard single-init behavior
- Plan to decouple `UIController` from direct instantiation in `GameRestController` and move to injected singleton later

---

#### Apr. 20 2025

**Goal: Implement dynamic search radius interaction using Leaflet; allow player to visually select a search area before starting a riddle round.**

- Enhanced `main.js` with interactive radius selection logic:
  - Player can freely click to move their location on the map at any time
  - A blue circular overlay (`L.circle`) reflects the current search radius
  - A slider (`#radius-slider`) dynamically adjusts the radius in real time
  - Player’s coordinates and radius are updated together when initiating a round

- Added `start-round` control panel to the UI:
  - HTML includes a hidden div (`#radius-ui`) with a slider and a "Start Round" button
  - Once player is initialized, the control panel is displayed
  - Clicking "Start Round" sends the player’s current location and selected radius to the backend

- Backend:
  - Updated `GameRestController` to accept `POST /api/game/start-round` with `StartRoundRequest` DTO
  - Request includes latitude, longitude, angle, and radius
  - The backend updates player position (`updatePlayerPosition`) before applying radius filter (`applySearchArea`)
  - Log statements print filtered landmarks and the selected target for verification
  - Added new endpoint `GET /api/game/target` to return current target landmark

- Target display (front-end):
  - After starting a round, frontend fetches `/api/game/target` to retrieve current target info
  - Target name, riddle, and coordinates are shown in the UI info box
  - A new marker is placed on the map to indicate the target location
  - Logic ensures `/target` is only fetched after round is successfully started (avoids 404)

##### JavaScript Logic Summary

```
main.js
├── updatePlayerPositionOnMap(lat, lng)
│   ├── Updates marker
│   ├── Updates circle
│   └── Displays coordinates
├── attachInitHandler(map, callback)
│   └── Handles initial and subsequent clicks
├── startButton.addEventListener(...)
│   ├── Sends payload to /start-round
│   └── Then fetches /api/game/target and updates target UI
```

##### Design Notes

- Circle visualization is kept in sync with both player movement and slider value
- Start-round endpoint is responsible for setting both position and search area
- Target is only fetched after the round starts, ensuring up-to-date information
- UIController is now managed by Spring (`@Component`) and injected via constructor, ensuring session state is preserved between requests


---

#### Apr. 21 2025

**Goal: Implement full puzzle loop logic with proximity detection and answer submission; remove UIController and consolidate session logic.**

- Refactored backend controller:
  - `UIController` fully removed; all logic merged into `GameRestController`
  - `GameRestController` now manages `GameSession` and `GameDataRepo` directly
  - All endpoints operate on internally stored `session` object

- Added `/api/game/submit-answer` endpoint:
  - Handles current puzzle submission
  - Returns `"All riddles solved!"` if no next target
  - Otherwise, server logs and returns `"Next target: {name}"`

- Enhanced proximity interaction on the frontend:
  - Removed confirm popup for proximity
  - Added a persistent `Submit Answer` button next to “Start Round”
  - Button is hidden by default and only shown when the player is within 50m of the current target
  - If the player moves out of range, the button disappears again

- Target transition after answer:
  - Submitting an answer automatically fetches the next target
  - Target marker and UI update without reloading the page
  - If all riddles are completed, a finished message is shown and interaction is disabled

- Minor enhancements:
  - `searchRadiusCircle` is removed after starting the round and will not reappear on subsequent player moves
  - Target marker is now correctly removed and redrawn on each puzzle switch
  - Target proximity is re-evaluated every time the player moves

##### JavaScript Logic Summary

```
main.js
├── updatePlayerPositionOnMap(lat, lng)
│   ├── Moves marker
│   ├── Adjusts circle if it exists
│   ├── Syncs coordinates with backend
│   └── Triggers proximity check to current target
├── checkProximityToTarget(lat, lng)
│   ├── Shows submit button if within 50m of target
│   └── Hides button if player moves away
├── submitAnswer()
│   ├── Sends POST to /submit-answer
│   ├── On success, fetches next target and updates UI
│   └── If all riddles solved, disables interaction and shows final message
```

##### Design Notes

- `searchRadiusCircle` is now strictly a pre-round visual aid and removed after round starts
- `targetMarker` is stored and replaced cleanly across puzzle transitions
- State variables like `currentTargetLatLng` and `window.answerPromptShown` ensure UI logic consistency
- Entire puzzle loop (init → move → start → solve → next) is now complete and seamless

--- 

#### Apr. 29 2025

**Goal: Build a complete player authentication system with MongoDB integration; prepare frontend for modular refactor.**

---

- **Refactored backend authentication system:**
  - Implemented `AuthController` with endpoints `/register`, `/login`, `/logout`
  - `register` generates a unique `playerId` (UUID) and stores it in MongoDB
  - `login` validates `username/password` and returns the corresponding `playerId`
  - `logout` placeholder implemented (future extensibility)
  - Created `User` entity:
    - Annotated with `@Document("users")`
    - Used `playerId` as the Mongo `_id`
  - Created `UserRepository` extending `MongoRepository<User, String>`:
    - Added method `findByUsername(String username)`

- **MongoDB setup completed:**
  - Integrated Spring Boot MongoDB connection via `application.properties`
  - Successfully registered and stored users into the MongoDB `scavengerhunt` database
  - Verified database contents through Docker Mongo shell

- **Frontend authentication flow established:**
  - Added `register()`, `login()`, and `logout()` functions in `main.js`
  - Successfully stored `playerId` in `localStorage` upon login
  - Dynamic UI update:
    - If logged in, hide Register/Login, show Logout
    - If logged out, show Register/Login, hide Logout
  - After successful registration, automatic login flow implemented

- **Frontend HTML structure adjustments:**
  - Created a dedicated `auth-controls` section for Register/Login/Logout buttons
  - `DOMContentLoaded` now binds all button actions
  - Preserved Leaflet.js map initialization

---

##### Design Notes

- `User` entity now cleanly mapped to MongoDB, using `playerId` as the document `_id`
- Frontend authentication state is driven entirely by localStorage
- Registration flow directly transitions into login without user re-entry
- Codebase now cleanly separates **data model (User)**, **data access (UserRepository)**, and **API layer (AuthController)**
- MongoDB acts as the single source of truth for player authentication data
- Frontend ready for modularization in the next phase (separating map control, auth control, game control)

---

#### Apr. 30 2025

**Goal: Integrate MongoDB-based landmark storage and session-based game state management; unify all data access through `GameDataRepository` and prepare backend for round logic (start/submit/target).**

---

- **Backend MongoDB integration for landmark system:**
  - Created `Landmark` model with `@Document("landmarks")`, supporting `name`, `riddle`, `latitude`, `longitude`
  - Replaced hardcoded landmark list with MongoDB as persistent source
  - Defined `LandmarkRepository` extending `MongoRepository<Landmark, String>`
  - Added `AdminController` with endpoints:
    - `/insert-landmarks`: Insert predefined landmarks
    - `/clear-landmarks`: Wipe landmark collection
    - `/insert-users`: Insert test admin user

- **Game data architecture refactor:**
  - Introduced `GameDataRepository` as the **unified backend access layer** for both `UserRepository` and `LandmarkRepository`
  - `GameDataRepository` now handles:
    - Loading all landmarks (used by `LandmarkManager`)
    - Future: filtering by region or radius (planned extension)
    - Loading and updating user solved landmark list
  - `GameRestController` now delegates all DB interactions through `GameDataRepository`

- **Game session management:**
  - `GameSession` manages player-specific state:
    - Player location
    - Solved landmark tracking
    - Current target and local landmark pool
  - `sessionMap<String, GameSession>` used to track per-player sessions in `GameRestController`
  - `update-position` endpoint implemented:
    - Supports **both logged-in and guest users**
    - Automatically creates a new `GameSession` if one does not exist

- **Frontend logic refinement:**
  - Introduced `ensurePlayerId()` to support guest play via auto-generated UUID stored in `localStorage`
  - `updatePlayerPosition()` sends `playerId`, `lat`, `lng`, and `angle` to backend
  - Added `playerMarker` logic to update Leaflet map marker only after response confirmation
  - Modularized logic to better support upcoming `/start-round` and `/submit-answer` endpoints

---

##### Design Notes

- Full separation between `LandmarkManager` (game logic) and `GameDataRepository` (data access) is now in place
- `GameRestController` acts as stateful per-player dispatcher; avoids misuse of shared data by isolating sessions
- Frontend supports anonymous play (auto-created `guest-UUID`) while maintaining same API call structure as authenticated users
- Data source consolidation allows MongoDB to act as single source of truth for **both** authentication and gameplay records
- Current foundation is now ready for implementation of `/start-round`, `/get-target`, `/submit-answer` puzzle flow

---

#### May. 7 2025

**Goal: Finalize round-based gameplay flow with full puzzle lifecycle: player location/angle updates, target selection, answer submission, and end-of-round detection. Added directional arrow logic and angle-based validation.**

* **Leaflet-based player direction logic:**

  * Integrated `leaflet.rotatedMarker` to support player orientation rendering
  * Player drag interaction now sets both position and facing angle:

    * `mousedown` stores drag start
    * `mousemove` continuously rotates marker based on drag vector
    * `mouseup` finalizes location and angle, then posts to `/update-position`
  * Implemented `calculateAngle(start, end)` for consistent rotation (0° = North, clockwise)

* **Frontend angle + proximity check:**

  * `checkProximityAndDirection()` compares player facing to target angle
  * Shows `Submit Answer` button only when:

    * Distance to target < 50m
    * Angle difference ≤ 30°
  * UI updates in real-time on drag or rotation

* **Endpoint behavior cleanup:**

  * `/start-round`: initializes session and filters local landmark pool; does **not** select a target
  * `/first-target`: selects and returns first unsolved target if `currentTarget == null`
  * `/submit-answer`:

    * If `currentTarget` is null, triggers first target selection
    * On valid submission, advances to next target
    * Returns `"All riddles solved!"` string when no targets remain

* **Frontend flow updates:**

  * Removed usage of deprecated `/next-target` endpoint
  * After starting round, frontend calls `/first-target` to display first puzzle
  * `Submit` button triggers `/submit-answer`, handles either:

    * JSON (next target)
    * String (final message)
  * `target-info` is updated accordingly; proximity is re-evaluated

* **Backend session logic:**

  * `GameSession`:

    * Maintains `currentTarget`, `solvedLandmarks`, and player position
    * `selectNextTarget()` chooses closest unsolved landmark
    * `submitCurrentAnswer()` adds solved landmark and checks for completion
  * `GameRestController`:

    * `/submit-answer` uses `Map<String, String>` for simplicity
    * Automatically selects first target if none exists
    * Uses `serializeLandmark()` for consistent JSON return
  * `first-target` improved to avoid 404 by auto-selecting if `currentTarget == null`

##### Notes

* Round flow is now: `start-round → first-target → submit-answer (→ repeat)`
* Facing angle logic entirely frontend-driven
* No redundant state on frontend—player and target vectors are computed per interaction
* System supports both guest and logged-in users with unified logic

---

#### **May. 17 2025**

**Goal: Integrate puzzle generation pipeline with gameplay flow; introduce `PuzzleManager` to decouple riddle retrieval from frontend logic. Finalize backend riddle management and database structure.**

* **PuzzleManager integration:**

  * Introduced `PuzzleManager` Java class to decouple riddle selection logic from `GameRestController`
  * Provided method `getRiddleForLandmark(String landmarkId)` that:

    * Queries MongoDB `riddles` collection using `RiddleRepository`
    * Returns the first available `"mysterious"` style riddle for the given landmark
    * Falls back to a default message if no riddle is found
  * Enabled injection of `PuzzleManager` via `@PostConstruct` in `GameRestController`

* **Riddle model and database setup:**

  * Defined `Riddle.java` to match MongoDB schema:

    * `landmarkId`, `style`, `source`, `content`, `metadata`
  * Created `RiddleRepository` interface extending `MongoRepository`
  * Populated MongoDB `riddles` collection via Python script `riddle_generator.py`, using GPT-based generation with multi-style support
  * Ensured one-to-many mapping between landmarks and riddles

* **Frontend riddle support:**

  * No changes required in frontend JavaScript or HTML
  * `/first-target` and `/submit-answer` endpoints now return `target.riddle` automatically via backend merging logic
  * Frontend displays updated riddle content in the UI without requiring structural changes

* **Backend session update:**

  * `GameRestController`:

    * Augmented target response map to include puzzle text via `PuzzleManager`
    * Ensured puzzle delivery is consistent across target initialization and submission steps

* **Development workflow enhancements:**

  * `riddle_generator.py` refactored to support:

    * MongoDB-based landmark loading
    * Chainable calls: `.load().generate().saveToDB().saveToFile()`
    * GPT-4-based riddle generation with style control
  * Aligned Python data structure with Java entity schema for seamless interoperability

##### Notes

* All riddles now served dynamically from database; `Landmark.riddle` field deprecated
* Puzzle retrieval logic fully modular via `PuzzleManager`, enabling future support for:

  * Style preference
  * Difficulty adaptation
  * User personalization
* Frontend logic remains clean and API-driven, with riddle display abstracted from data source

---

#### **Jun. 28–29 2025**

* **Elo-based scoring mechanism:**

  * Introduced rating fields to both `User` and `Landmark` classes:
    * `rating`, `uncertainty`, and `displayRating`
    * All initialized based on Glicko/CAP standards (rating = 0.0, uncertainty = 0.5)
  * Elo logic follows the CAP-based HSHS (High-Speed High-Stakes) scoring model:
    * Implemented in Python (`elo_calculator_demo.py`), to be ported to Java
    * Player and landmark ratings are updated only:
      * When a correct answer is submitted
      * Or after 3 failed attempts
  * Game round allows up to 3 attempts per riddle, with a 30-minute time limit for scoring

* **Backend detection logic overhaul:**

  * Introduced `playerCone` using JTS `Polygon` to represent player’s visible cone
  * `GeoUtils.detectedLandmark(...)` method:
    * Takes all city-wide landmark geometries (not just radius-limited candidates)
    * Returns the most directionally aligned intersecting landmark within the player's field of view
    * Prioritizes usability over spatial rigor for MVP purposes
  * Rationale: While current algorithmic detection is approximate, future work will explore AR-based landmark detection for precise vision-based validation

##### Updated Game Core Logic

1. **Answer Eligibility**: A puzzle can be answered if player view cone ∩ any `landmark.geometry` ≠ ∅  
2. **Answering Flow**: When eligible, player clicks Submit Answer; backend validates answer
3. **Attempt Limit**: Up to 3 attempts per puzzle; max time: 30 minutes
4. **Elo Update**: Ratings update on either correct answer or after 3 failed attempts

##### Supporting Class/Module Changes

- Updated `Player` class to render `JTS` `playerCone` to check visibility intersection with landmark polygons
- Updated `GeoUtils` class to provide detection logic of player vs. landmarks:
  - **Note**: MVP uses best-aligned algorithmic match; this is intentionally approximate for current usability
  - **Future Work**: Replace with AR-based vision detection for precise validation

- Rewrote `PlayerStateManager`, `LandmarkManager`, and related classes:
  - `PlayerStateManager` maintains current detected landmark and `solvedLandmarksID` (now only for frontend rendering; no longer used in difficulty modulation)
  - `LandmarkManager` maintains:
    - `allRoundLandmarks`: landmarks in current round (within radius)
    - `allLocalLandmarkIds`: all city-wide landmarks eligible for answering
  - `GameSession` manages:
    - Verifies current target is consistent with player's detected landmark
    - Tracks number of attempts and timer per riddle
    - Records global completion timestamp (for future extension)
    - Elo module queries `GameSession` to apply rating updates

#### **Jul. 5–8 2025**

* **Game logic and session management:**

  * Refactored and enhanced `GameSession`:
    * Tracks current puzzle state, attempt count, and start timestamp
    * Determines if puzzle is still answerable (within time and attempt limits)
    * Flags when Elo update is needed (on correct answer or after 3 failed attempts)
  
  * Clarified responsibilities between `PlayerStateManager` and `LandmarkManager`:
    * `PlayerStateManager`: tracks current visible landmark and solved status, used only for frontend rendering
    * `LandmarkManager`: manages `allRoundLandmarks` (current round pool) and `allLocalLandmarkIds` (city-wide answerable landmarks)

* **Game session unit testing:**

  * Added tests simulating user answer flow:
    * Incremental attempt submission
    * Time-based expiry
    * Correct/incorrect answers
  * Verified internal state transitions and rating update conditions

* **Elo integration and module encapsulation:**

  * Ported CAP-based HSHS model from `elo_calculator_demo.py` into Java service module
  * Supports real-time Elo calculation based on response time and correctness
  * Exposed `applyRatingUpdate(Player p, Landmark l, boolean correct, int secondsUsed)` API for `GameSession` use

#### **Jul. 9 2025**

* **PuzzleManager rewrite:**

  * Refactored puzzle logic into modular `PuzzleManager`:
    * Accepts `landmarkId` and calls Python `RiddleGenerator` service
    * Saves generated riddle and its creation timestamp
    * Initializes relevant fields in `GameSession` upon first attempt
    * Returns riddle and optional `meta.description` for frontend display

* **Frontend structure update:**

  * Updated role-based behavior in `main.js`:
    * Admins retain simulated click-to-move interaction
    * Guests and regular players now follow real-time position logic (mocked for now; GPS/WebSocket support planned)
  
  * Adjusted riddle submission interaction:
    * Submit button only appears when player is within cone & distance to landmark
    * Removed static submission trigger; now dynamically toggled via `checkProximityAndDirection()`

#### **Jul. 10 2025**

* **Local HTTPS testing & geolocation permission debugging:**

  * Attempted to expose frontend to LAN by running:  
    ```bash
    ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
    ```
  * Created local HTTPS certificate using:
    ```bash
    keytool -genkeypair -alias scavengerhunt -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 3650
    ```
  * Geolocation worked on first access, but failed to re-request permission after logout, likely due to HTTPS trust issue;
  * Switched to `ngrok https` tunnel to expose local server publicly;
  * iPad access now stable with HTTPS, ready for integrating gyroscope/GPS input in future stages.

#### **Jul. 11–19 2025**

* **Core mechanics validated:**

  * Finalized game flow:
    * `GameSession` tracks `currentTarget`, `targetPool`, and user responses (correct/incorrect);
    * `GameRestController.submitAnswer()` receives `secondsUsed` and triggers full validation;
    * Handles timeouts, undetected targets, and ends game gracefully when pool is exhausted;

  * Riddle submission pipeline and scoring integrated:
    * `submitCurrentAnswer()` calls `EloCalculator` internally;
    * Both player and landmark ratings are updated;
    * Rating fallback logic added (`null → 0.5`) to ensure robustness;

  * EloCalculator deployed:
    * Implements a custom HSHS scoring model based on correctness + time efficiency;
    * Dynamic K-factor calculated from inferred uncertainty (based on time since last activity);
    * Sigmoid mapping planned to classify difficulty tiers from rating values;
    * Ratings and uncertainties are no longer persisted, computed live from timestamps;

  * Logging and debugging enhanced:
    * All rating operations include `[EloCalc]` console output;
    * Handles and avoids NaN/null cases;
    * Logs target pool status and state transitions throughout gameplay;

  * Functionality verified:
    * Python script used to simulate and test convergence behavior of HSHS model;
    * Ratings for both user and landmark fluctuate and stabilize during real interactions;
    * Frontend now correctly reflects answer state, controls submit visibility, and triggers next round as expected;

  * Foundation for next phase:
    * `PuzzleManager` will use landmark rating to guide riddle difficulty;
    * Full game round stats per user will be collected for future visualization and analysis.

#### **Aug. 6 2025**

* **Device orientation calibration system:**

  * **Challenge identification**: Realized that accurate angle measurement requires device to be properly oriented during initialization:
    * Browser APIs don't support direct access to absolute device orientation
    * `DeviceOrientationEvent.alpha` provides relative orientation from arbitrary starting position
    * Without calibration, view cone direction would be incorrect relative to real-world geography

  * **Walking-based calibration mechanism**: Introduced step-based calibration to establish absolute orientation:
    * User prompted to "lay device flat and walk 2-3 meters" when calibration starts
    * System collects GPS points during movement (`distance > 0.4m` threshold)
    * Calculates movement bearing using `calculateAngle(startPoint, endPoint)`
    * Stores `calibratedAngleOffset` as the absolute direction user was facing during calibration

  * **Map tracking mode implementation**: Post-calibration behavior mimics navigation app experience:
    * **View cone**: Always points toward screen top (fixed in screen coordinates)
    * **Map rotation**: Dynamically rotates to maintain correct real-world correspondence
    * **Formula**: `mapRotation = -(calibratedAngleOffset + currentPlayerAngle)`
    * **Effect**: Device rotates X degrees → map counter-rotates X degrees, maintaining geographic accuracy

  * **Angle calculation logic**: Unified angle handling across different user modes:
    * **Admin mode**: Uses `testPlayerAngle` for manual testing
    * **Calibrated mode**: Uses `calibratedAngleOffset + playerAngle` for accurate real-world mapping  
    * **Uncalibrated mode**: Falls back to raw `playerAngle` from device orientation

  * **UI/UX improvements**:
    * Added calibration status display with current offset angle
    * Real-time angle display for debugging
    * Start Round button disabled until calibration completed
    * Automatic localStorage cleanup to prevent data corruption from previous sessions

  * **Technical implementation**:
    * `startCalibration()`: Initiates GPS tracking and point collection
    * `finishCalibration()`: Computes bearing and sets global calibration state
    * `updatePlayerViewCone()`: Handles both cone positioning and map rotation
    * `applyMapRotation(angle)`: Applies CSS transform to map container
    * Consistent angle calculation in both `initGame()` and `startRound()` APIs

  * **Validation**: System successfully achieves navigation-like behavior where view cone appears fixed on screen while map rotates to maintain real-world accuracy, enabling intuitive landmark detection gameplay.

  * **Critical frontend-backend synchronization fix**: Resolved viewCone display vs detection inconsistency
    * **Problem**: Frontend showed visual overlap but backend detection failed randomly
    * **Root cause**: Angle calculation inconsistencies across functions (`initGame` vs `startRound` vs `updateViewCone`)
    * **Double calibration bug**: `playerAngle = heading - rawAngleAtCalibration` then `angle = calibratedAngleOffset + playerAngle`
    * **Core issue**: Frontend used real-time angles, backend used stale stored angles from last `startRound`

  * **Solution implementation**:
    * **Unified angle calculation**: `angle = (calibratedAngleOffset + playerAngle) % 360` everywhere
    * **Eliminate double calibration**: Store raw `playerAngle = heading` in `handleOrientation`
    * **Real-time synchronization**: Submit `currentAngle` in answer requests, update backend player state immediately
    * **Frontend**: `{userId, secondsUsed, currentAngle, latitude, longitude}`
    * **Backend**: `session.updatePlayerPosition(latitude, longitude, currentAngle)` before detection

  * **Architectural transformation**:
    * **From**: Asynchronous angle sync with stored state
    * **To**: Synchronous real-time angle transmission
    * **Result**: "What You See Is What You Get" - visual overlap guarantees detection success
    * **Validation**: Pre-fix `199.5°` vs `128.44°` inconsistency → Post-fix `231.24°` perfect sync

  * **First-person view enhancement**: Implemented map rotation to create immersive navigation experience
    * **Two-phase approach**: First stabilize viewCone-map relationship, then add CSS rotation
    * **Phase 1**: Ensure calibration accuracy with `coneAngle = (calibratedAngleOffset + playerAngle) % 360`
    * **Phase 2**: Real-time map rotation with `INIT_MAP.getContainer().style.transform = rotate(-currentAbsoluteAngle)deg`
    * **Design principle**: Separate functional correctness from visual presentation - maintains detection accuracy while viewCone always points toward phone's top
