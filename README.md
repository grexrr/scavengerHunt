# scavengerHunt

**Scavenger Hunt(Un-named)** is an interactive Java-based location puzzle game enhanced by a Python backend. The game challenges players to find real-world landmarks based on riddles. Players navigate a rendered map, receive clues, and interact using keyboard and mouse controls. The system evaluates user actions and determines success based on spatial accuracy and orientation.

This module demonstrates full-stack coordination between a Java desktop application and a lightweight Python server using RESTful APIs, with a strong focus on geospatial interaction and puzzle-solving mechanics.


### Dev Log

#### Mar. 24 2025
**Remark: The log is scratch written in Chinese and generated with help of ChatGPT. It WILL NOT be used for thesis paper submission.** 

- Project bootstrapped using Spring Boot 3.4.4 with Maven (Java 17)
- Initialized base package: `com.scavengerhunt`
- Added `.game` module:
  - **Player**: encapsulates core player data, including location, orientation, solved landmarks, and game status
  - **PlayerStateManager**: manages player's game state transitions and interactions, such as current target updates and game completion
  - **Landmark**: defines the landmark data model (ID, name, location, riddle, solved status)
  - **LandmarkManager**: handles landmark filtering, selection, and navigation logic during a game session
- Added `.utils` module:
  - **GeoUtils**: performs geographical distance calculations (Haversine formula) used for radius checks and proximity comparison
- Added `.data` module:
  - **LocalGameDataManager**: MVP-stage repository that loads hardcoded landmarks and saves player progress via standard I/O or console

##### Project Progress Summary (up to Mar. 24, 2025)

This phase focused on **validating module communication, state transitions, and data flow**, in preparation for the MVP milestone. Specifically, the goal was to ensure that the core gameplay logic — player progress tracking, landmark selection, riddle sequencing — could function end-to-end even without a graphical interface.

##### Modules Designed and Tested:
- `Player` / `PlayerStateManager`: encapsulates user position, solved history, and current puzzle state
- `Landmark` / `LandmarkManager`: supports filtering landmarks by radius, selecting the next target by proximity, and separating loaded landmarks (`localLandmarks`) from dynamically updated game targets (`unsolvedLandmarks`)
- `GeoUtils`: utility for distance-based filtering
- `LocalGameDataManager`: temporary I/O controller to load landmark data and save solved history
- **TestRunner** (Pipeline testing data transmission between Module): simulated game loop that loads data → selects puzzle → marks solved → selects next

##### Data Flow Simulated:
1. Player initializes at fixed lat/lng coordinates
2. Landmarks are loaded from a stubbed source (`LocalGameDataManager`)
3. The player defines a circular search area (simulated radius)
4. A filtered puzzle pool is created → the nearest landmark is selected
5. Player “solves” the puzzle → LandmarkManager updates `unsolvedLandmarks`
6. The next target is chosen based on proximity
7. If no further landmarks remain, the game ends and the state is saved

##### Issues & Solution:
The module-oriented development approach has led to structural confusion issues. We have decided to adopt a **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD) + Use Case First development methodology for the next phase of work to see if it can alleviate these problems.


#### Next Step: MVP UI Integration

Having validated the core gameplay logic in a console-based simulation, the next step is to begin **UI-layer integration**, where player inputs and spatial movement will drive visual feedback and real-time interactions.

##### Goals:
- Implement a minimal graphical UI
- Display player position and surrounding landmarks
- Simulate area selection (A key → drag to create search radius)
- Show directional arrow to guide player toward current target
- Enable answer submission (B key) with orientation validation
- Sync UI feedback with existing game state logic (PlayerStateManager & LandmarkManager)


#### Mar. 29, 2025

##### Updated Design Notes

- Separated the pure data layer (`LandmarkRepo`) from the stateful game logic (`PuzzleController`)
- Introduced `MapUIStateManager` to sync internal state with frontend rendering
- Added `GameSession` as the bridge between logic and UI, encapsulating player and puzzle states
- Kept `PuzzleController` focused on single-round management: provides methods such as `submitAnswer()`, `getCurrentTarget()`, and `isFinished()`
- The UI layer communicates exclusively with `GameSession` or `GameUIController`

##### Frontend Strategy (Revised)

- The MVP map is rendered using Leaflet inside an HTML page, embedded through JavaFX WebView or opened in a browser window
- User interaction is handled through key/mouse/touch input passed to the backend
- Future extension paths:
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile browser compatibility
  - Embedding the WebView into a native Android/iOS app using frameworks such as Flutter, React Native, or Cordova
  - Full native mobile frontend rewrite for later phases (as needed)

##### Progress Recap

###### PuzzleController & LandmarkRepo Refinement
- Responsibilities clarified:
  - `PuzzleController` maintains round-specific state, such as the target pool and progress tracking
  - `LandmarkRepo` acts as a data provider with geospatial filtering, no longer maintains round state
- Achieved strict use-case alignment by avoiding logic duplication and state coupling

###### Session Layer Implementation
- `GameSession` introduced to orchestrate state between player, puzzle logic, and data
- Ensures a clean API surface for the frontend
- Facilitates long-term modularity and scalability

###### UI Prototype Integration
- `UIController` implemented as the first-layer interface between the frontend and logic
- Tested a terminal-based MVP flow:
  - Initializes a player
  - Applies a search radius to create the puzzle pool
  - Handles answer submission and target progression
  - Detects game completion cleanly


##### Insights from MVP Debugging

- `GameDataRepo` should evolve into a unified backend communication hub:
  - Manages not only landmark/riddle retrieval, but also future player data syncing
  - Will eventually integrate with a Python REST API backend

- Layer separation (Repo ↔ Controller ↔ Session ↔ UI) proved valuable for testability and logic clarity

##### Next Focus Areas

###### 1. Simulated Player Movement
- Add tools to manually or programmatically update player position
- Dynamically affect game state and puzzle logic
- Used to validate spatial correctness and navigation feedback

###### 2. Distance-Based Puzzle Validation
- Implement `evaluateCurrentTarget()` with geolocation checks
- Later enhance to include directional angle (facing logic)
- Might involve an `AnswerEvaluator` utility or similar abstraction

###### 3. Strengthen Frontend Visualization
- Decide and initiate the map rendering layer:
  - JavaFX + embedded Leaflet HTML
  - Or fully browser-based progressive web frontend
- Immediate goal: visualize player and landmarks on a map

### 🌀 Reflection

Although the game logic layer is solid, the UI brings substantial added complexity. Key challenges include:

- Interactive graphics (maps, players, arrows)
- User input handling (mouse and keyboard)
- Synchronizing state across logic and UI layers

However, once the map visualization is functional, additional game features will become significantly easier to build.
